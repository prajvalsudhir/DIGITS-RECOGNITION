# DIGITS-RECOGNITION
Convolutional neural network built to recognise handwritten digits

The model is trained on the MNIST dataset.

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.
The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.Half of the training set and half of the test set were taken from NIST's training dataset, while the other half of the training set and the other half of the test set were taken from NIST's testing dataset.

* The Model has been trained using Keras and Tensorflow 2.0 frameworks

* The images have been normalised and scaled for training.

* The lables have been converted to categorical values(one-hot encoding) for multi-class classification

* Model has shown a training accuracy of 99.01% and validation accuracy of 98.54%
